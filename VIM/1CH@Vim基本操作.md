"When I attend the World Trade Organization, I am seeing that trade disputes or
negative sentiments are not uncommon these days," Yau said. "There are still as
a lot of gaps between, say,
 developed economies with less developed sectors."

He added there are also a lack of consensus on some very major issues that
should support international trade, such as e-commerce, investment facilitation
and support of micro, small or medium enterprises.

"All these are very important and pertinent questions that one would seek to
address but they do not find favor or consensus among major players," Yau said.

"While Hong Kong enjoys quite a warm trading environment on this side of Asia-
Pacific, but actually the world is not uniformed," he said.

He said Hong Kong people should, on one hand, seize opportunities particularly
those given rise by the Belt and Road and Bay Area Initiative, and on the other
hand, be cautious of rising protectionist sentiment.

"I will say that for the coming year we should stay alert but remain positive."
